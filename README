What is Scream Grid?

Scream Grid is a data grid for Business Intelligence that you can adapt easily to any website.
It works very similar to an Excel dynamic table or other complex tools like Oracle Discoverer.
This project is still in a very alpha stage but all code is Open Source so feel free to play with it and to give us a hand!

Installation Guide

1. Download the source code.
2. Modify the screamGrid.js to satisfy your needs, either add the information statically or generate the array dynamically (updates on this soon)
3. Add an html div tag with id=”put-grid-here”. screamGrid with jQuery. $(‘#put-grid-here’).opengrid();
4. And there you go screamGrid is ready to be used.
